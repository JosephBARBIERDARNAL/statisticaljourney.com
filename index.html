                    <p>This article explains why every statistical calculation should be done for specific, well-defined reasons. In other words, you need to know why you're doing what you're doing.</p>

                    <p>It's important to focus on differences rather than similarities, and not to rely on self-reported data, as individuals may not really understand the reasons for their own success.</p>

                    <p>Can we really make statistics say anything we want? It's a common belief to think that numbers and stats, put the right way, can say anything we want. However, I will try to explain why people think (wrongly) that we can manipulate stats as we want.</p>
