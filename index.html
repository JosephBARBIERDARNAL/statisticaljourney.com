        <h1>Importance of statistics</h1><hr>
        <h4>Fundamental tool for understanding the world</h4>
        <p>
            Statistics is the science of learning from data. It is the art of collecting,
            analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. It is a method of
            <strong>reasoning and a way of thinking</strong>. It is a way of understanding the world and
            making decisions. However, technical knowledge is far from sufficient to use
            this tool in a relevant and reasoned way: we need to understand the <strong>epistemological
            framework</strong> in which our methods of calculation, interpretation and analysis are embedded.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 28px;">Here starts the statistical journey.</p>
        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>
            This minimalist site brings together <strong>non-technical and narrative</strong> articles
            on the subject of statistics and their relevance to everyday life. It's intended as a means
            of better understanding why statistical thinking is a good epistemological method, whether you
            use statistics or not.

                    <p>
                        We tend to overestimate our ability to find pattern. We specially tend to see patterns where there are none.
                        Fortunately, statistics and epistemology can help us have a better understanding of what's random and what's not.
