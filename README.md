# Statistical Journey

> [statisticaljourney.com](https://www.statisticaljourney.com)

This minimalist site brings together **non-technical and narrative** articles on the subject of statistics and their relevance to everyday life. It's intended as a means of **better understanding** why statistical thinking is a good epistemological method, whether you use statistics or not.

## Contributions

- I'm currently looking for **content feedback**, especially from people who have worked with statistics. If you think you're a good match, open an [issue](https://github.com/JosephBARBIERDARNAL/statisticaljourney.com/issues) with your thoughts.

- If you want to **add you own article** or **improve an existing one**, you can open a [pull request](https://github.com/JosephBARBIERDARNAL/statisticaljourney.com/pulls). If you don't know how to do that, you can also open an [issue](https://github.com/JosephBARBIERDARNAL/statisticaljourney.com/issues) explaining what you want to do and I'll help you.
